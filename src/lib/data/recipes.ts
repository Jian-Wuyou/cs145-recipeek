        instructions:
            "<ol> <li>Set a rack in the bottom of a 6-quart Instant PotÂ® and add 3 cups water. Stack the potatoes on the rack. Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 15 minutes. </li> <li>After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, turn off the heat and let the steam release naturally for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, follow the manufacturer's guide for steam release and allow any residual steam to air out. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid; transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the half-and-half, butter, sour cream and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Mash with a potato masher until desired texture and smoothness. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. </li> </ol>",

        ingredients: {
            potato: 8,
            butter: 3,
            cheese: 1,
            onion: 3,
        },
        instructions:
            "<ol> <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. </li> <li>Place the potatoes on a baking sheet. Rub them with the canola oil and bake for 1 hour, making sure they're sufficiently cooked through. </li> <li>Slice the butter into pats. Place in a large mixing bowl and add the bacon bits and sour cream. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F.</li> <li>With a sharp knife, cut each potato in half lengthwise. Scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl, being careful not to tear the shell. Leave a small rim of potato intact for support. Lay the hollowed out potato shells on a baking sheet. </li> <li>Smash the potatoes into the butter, bacon and sour cream. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and black pepper to taste and mix together well. (IMPORTANT: If you plan to freeze the twice-baked potatoes, do NOT add the green onions.) </li> <li>Fill the potato shells with the filling. I like to fill the shells so they look abundant and heaping. Top each potato with a little more grated cheese and pop 'em in the oven until the potato is warmed through, 15 to 20 minutes. </li> </ol>",

        },
        instructions:
            "<ol> <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.</li> <li>Leaving peel on, cut the potatoes into 6 lengthwise to make long wedges, about 3/4-inch to 1-inch wide. Combine the potatoes, oil, salt and cayenne on the baking sheet and toss to combine. (1 less bowl to wash) Arrange the potatoes on a baking sheet in a single layer, so a cut side is in contact with the pan, but evenly spaced so the potatoes aren't touching each other. Bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 30 minutes. Slip a spatula under the potatoes to turn them over and cook for 5 minutes more.</li> <li>Transfer potatoes to a serving dish and serve immediately.</li> </ol>",

Let the skins dry in the colander so that some of the salt crystallizes.</li> <li>Meanwhile, put the butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted. Serve the potatoes hot with the butter for dipping.</li> </ol>',
